# TODO: Task 2: People Detection (25%) 
# Run detection on each frame, output bounding boxes for detected people, and filter obvious false positives (e.g., by size or region of interest).

# TODO: Task 3: People Counting (15%)
# Using your detection results, estimate the number of people present in each frame. Compare these estimated 
# counts with the ground-truth counts for the same frames and compute per-frame errors. Summarize
# your performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and discuss how well 
# your system counts people overall. If you incorporate temporal tracking to stabilize counts over time, 
# briefly explain your tracking approach and how it affects the counting accuracy.
